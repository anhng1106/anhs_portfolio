            Hello! I'm <strong>Anh Nguyen</strong>, a passionate full-stack
            developer who loves turning ideas into intuitive digital
            experiences. With a strong foundation in frontend technologies like
            ReactJS or Next.js, I specialize in building responsive, accessible,
            and high-performing web applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the past few years from school to reality worklife, Iâ€™ve worked
            on projects ranging from AI-powered voice ordering systems to
            large-scale audience data platforms. I thrive on clean design,
            efficient code, and collaborative teamwork. Whether itâ€™s designing
            with Figma or querying data with Supabase, Iâ€™m always eager to learn
            and push boundaries.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring design trends, cooking
            food, or enjoying a good cup of coffee with friends ðŸ˜„.
